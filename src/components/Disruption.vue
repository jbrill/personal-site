    <h4>Thesis</h4>
      <p>"DISRUPTION" developed my curiosity for human interaction. As a software engineer, I believe it's imperative to dwell on the affect that software has on the developer, and the effect that software has on the world.</p>
      <p>"DISRUPTION" sets out to weigh the tension between technology's utopian intention -- making human lives easier -- with the brutally realist depiction of technology's place in our world.</p>
    <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
    <p>"This project started out as a fascination with computers and phones on my generation. Screens have a collective affect on state of mind. The human mind responds to its environmentâ€¦ yet this environment changes as we as humans change. I question the meaning of technological innovation. Is our progress as human beings measured by more complexity? Are the objects we, as humans, create natural? As we shape the environment around us, how does this environment affect our own minds?</p>
    <p>These images span from screens and phones to architecture and nature, and from factories and industry to tourism and medicine. My hope is that some of these images spark a response in the viewer. We, as human beings, create complex forms full of symmetry and patterns, and yet the beauty of nature outmatches these forms. Nonetheless, advances in medicine allow us to live longer; developments in industry instill huge economic progress."

      <h4>Reflections</h4>
      <p>Our economic mobility relies on technological disruption. Technological disruption is encourage without consideration of environmental consequences.</p>
      <p>As we continue to innovate, we must remember to look back at how our innovation has served us to better design for the future.</p>
