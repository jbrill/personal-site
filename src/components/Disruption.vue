      <h4>Course</h4>
      <p>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</p>
      <p><i>Course:</i>&nbsp; RCARTS 385, Advanced Photography</p>
      <p><i>Professor:</i>&nbsp; Isaac Wingfield</p>
      <h4>Prompt</h4>
      <p>The aim of this project is to serve as an opportunity for exploration and discovery within photography, revealing your personal interests and the skills you gain over the semester. On completing this portfolio you should be prepared to move into your own creative practice as a photographer, using photography to accomplish goals you set, appropriately using the methods, tools and techniques available.</p>
      <p><i>Final Deliverable:</i>&nbsp Twenty (20) rolls with contact sheets, twenty (20) finished prints, and a written statement</p>
      <h4>Tools</h4>
      <p>Nikon F3 ðŸ“·</p>
      <p>Ilford HP5 Plus B+W</p>
    <h4>Ideation Process</h4>
    <ul id="ideation--process">
    <li>Keyword Mapping</li>
    <p>To begin fleshing our our subject ideas, our class started with a ideative assignment, using techniques from "Mapping the Intelligence of Artistic Work" by Anne West.<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Mapping_the_Intelligence_of_Artistic_Wor.html?id=4cOZZwEACAAJ" target="_blank" class="about__contain__footnote"> [1]</a></p>
    <img width="100%" src="@/assets/images/portfolio/disruption/mapping.jpg" />
    <p>The exercises were highly explorative -- the goal being to bring together a portfolio proposal. During the process, I found new ideas would emerge, and unrelated ideas would start to fall away.</p>
    <ul id="ideation--process-mapping">
        <li>Key Words</li>
		<p>Dr. West notes, "Key words hold the scent of our work. They are the word base for our writing, allowing us to build upon them as we generate open word maps.". I began the semester by jotting down ideas I find relevant to my proposal:</p>
        <img width="100%" src="@/assets/images/portfolio/disruption/key_words.jpg" />
        <li>Matrix Map</li>
        <p>This technique is used by a wide range of artists. Dr. West mentions a ceramist, Lee Johnson, who "is eager to find lines between his works and to discover a framework for how he has been thinking .This system of mapping allows him to work with information that is not only pertinent to now, but which is part of an overall journey, lasting a number of years. By containing it on one surface, he sees the resources at hand, and establishes a more synthetic perspective.":</p>
        <p>I mapped connections that I could decipher from within my list of words. This step was key to building non-linear connections between sets of words. The three lines, green, red, and blue, represented three broad topics -- vision, religion, and art.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="@/assets/images/portfolio/disruption/key_words_mapping.jpg" />
        <li>Five-Word Composite Map</li>
        <p>I then took the five words I found most significant from the previous exercise, and wrote down words I associate with them.</p>
        <table style="width:100%; font-size: small; padding-bottom: 2vh;">
	  <tr>
		<th>SPIRITUAL</th>
		<td>Inner-Self</td>
		<td>Introspection</td>
		<td>Epiphany</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th>AWARENESS</th>
		<td>Growth</td>

	  </tr>
	</table>
    </ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 3vh;">Gathering Inspiration</li>
    <p>After developing key words fom my mapping exercise, I sought inspiration from previous artists. My search consisted of artists recommended from my professor, as well as self-directed research on Man-Altered Landscapes.</p>

    <h4>Photographic Process</h4>
    <p>My photographic process was both technically and compositionally iterative.</p>
    <p>As I was developing my own film, as well as creating prints in a darkroom, I foudn that process to be relevant to the work as a whole. Developing film requires agitation, or disruption, and directly contributed to the nature of the work.</p>
    <h4>Thesis</h4>
      <p>"DISRUPTION" developed my curiosity for human interaction. As a software engineer, I believe it's imperative to dwell on the affect that software has on the developer, and the effect that software has on the world.</p>
      <p>"DISRUPTION" sets out to weigh the tension between technology's utopian intention -- making human lives easier -- with the brutally realist depiction of technology's place in our world.</p>
    <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
    <p>This project started out as a fascination with computers and phones on my generation. Screens have a collective affect on state of mind. The human mind responds to its environmentâ€¦ yet this environment changes as we as humans change. I question the meaning of technological innovation. Is our progress as human beings measured by more complexity? Are the objects we, as humans, create natural? As we shape the environment around us, how does this environment affect our own minds?</p>
    <p>These images span from screens and phones to architecture and nature, and from factories and industry to tourism and medicine. My hope is that some of these images spark a response in the viewer. We, as human beings, create complex forms full of symmetry and patterns, and yet the beauty of nature outmatches these forms. Nonetheless, advances in medicine allow us to live longer; developments in industry instill huge economic progress.

      <h4>Reflections</h4>
      <p>Our economic progress relies on technological disruption. Our personal growth begins with disruption.</p>
      <p>As we continue to innovate, we must remember to look back at how our innovation has served us to better design for the future.</p>
